# ASSESSMENT 3: Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

1. What is JSX? What is one syntax difference between HTML and JSX?

Your answer: JSX is the bridge between Javascript and HTML.  It allows developers to utilize React components.  One syntax difference between HTML and JSX is that the keyword class used in HTML would be className in JSX.  The reason behind this is that class is a protected keyword in Javascript.

Researched answer: To begin, JSX stands for JavaScript XML.  JSX allows developers to write HTML and JavaScript together in React.  This enables developers to use components that utilize the logic needed for the user interface.

2. What is yarn? What file(s) are modified in a React application when you run the command yarn in your terminal?

Your answer: Yarn is a JavaScript package manager which allows developers to create a React application containing node modules.  When yarn is run in the terminal, it modifies the node modules in the React application.

Researched answer: Yarn is a package manager created to bring efficiency and reliability when adding or creating dependencies.  Yarn allows developers to build React applications.  The file modified when running yarn in the terminal is the yarn lock file.

3. What is a React component? 

Your answer: A React component utilizes a variable called State, which determines the behavior of components or how it renders on a webpage.  Components fall under two categories.  A component can be referred to as a logic component, and it is determined if the component is holding data or State.  The other category a component can fall into is the display component when the component doesn’t contain data or State.

Researched answer: React components allow developers to create independent pieces of code, making it reusable. Using separate components enables the code to create specific user-face interactions with a desired behavior. Components are thought of as Javascript functions, allowing the component to accept input called props.  This is how developers can keep data and logic separate from the display component.

4. What is the difference between state values and props in React?

Your answer: The difference between state values and props in React is state values stores data that determines how the webpage will behave and display information.  Props, which are short for properties, allow input to pass through a component, helping the user-face interaction.

Researched answer: There are a few differences between state values and props in React.  For instance, props, also known as properties, allow for data or information to pass through or a way to communicate with components.  Props are considered read-only. It is immutable or cannot change.  As for state values, it is considered mutable, so change is the primary focus of their job.  State values take the information passed through props to create different possibilities to display dynamic information or data.

5. What is the DOM?

Your answer: DOM, also known as Document Object Model, is tool developers use to handle interaction with a user.  DOM is a way to listen to a user, so when a user clicks on a button, hovers over a link, or scrolls on a page, a developer will use DOM events to determine how the interaction should behave.  ß

Researched answer: DOM, also known as Document Object Model, handles the potential changes in structure, style, and content on a webpage.  Developers use DOM to listen to user input, like a mouse click, to determine the behavior the mouse click would create for the user. 

6. STRETCH: Which is the difference between a div and a span?

## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

1. Object-oriented programming: Object-oriented programming focuses on objects which contain unique attributes and behaviors.  Instead of focusing on functions and logic of programming, OOP is more concerned with the data.  The basic structure of OOP consists of classes, objects, methods, and attributes.  This allows developers to create a thing and how that thing should behave.  

2. Ruby: Ruby is a programming language, more specifically, an object-oriented programming language.  The language is very flexible to use.  It is used in many domains, like web development and automation.

3. Implicit return: Implicit return in JavaScript is when an arrow function returns a value without using the keyword return.

4. Ruby blocks: Ruby block is lines of codes placed inside the do and end keywords.  This is a block of code that can or cannot be placed in a code block.

5. Ruby hashes: Ruby hashes involve a collection of information, similar to an array, but instead of indexes, key-value pairs are used to access the data.
